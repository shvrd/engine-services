# my engine - now with fancy programming patterns

after reading the great book ["Game Programming Patterns" by Robert Nystrom](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/), i felt i needed to change the way i write
code - this is my first attempt at doing so.

## installation

first clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/shvrd/engine-services.git
```

then move into the folder and execute the setup script for your platform
```
cd engine-services
```
unix-like systems:
```
chmod a+x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
windows:
```
ps setup.ps1
```
you might need to enable remote scripts for powershell like [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-powershell-1.0/ee176961(v=technet.10))
